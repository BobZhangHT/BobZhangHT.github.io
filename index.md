## About Me

Hello, I'm **Hengtao Zhang**, a lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangdong Ocean University (GDOU). My academic journey in statistics has taken me through rigorous training and exploration: I earned my PhD in Statistics in 2022 from the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/index.php) at the University of Hong Kong, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Aijun Zhang](https://statsoft.org/) and [Prof. Guosheng Yin](https://saasresearch.hku.hk/~gyin/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Statistics at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn) in 2018.

With a foundational background in statistics and ongoing research interests, I am committed to advancing knowledge in the field through teaching and scholarly work. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research projects, publications, and academic activities.

## Research Interests
Biostatistics, Bayesian Statistics, Causal Inference, Statistical Machine Learning, Epidemiology
